# Mobile-friendly-landing-page

Converted a static landing page into a responsive one using CSS media queries.

## âœ… What I Did

- Added media queries for screens below 768px
- Stacked columns vertically for mobile
- Scaled text and images to fit smaller screens
- Ensured responsive navigation and footer
- Tested using Chrome DevTools (device toolbar)
